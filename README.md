***‚ö†Ô∏è Please Note:** The initial application preview may take **3 to 5 minutes to fully load** and boot the environment. Thank you for your patience.*

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Targeted Exercise Library:** Guided breathing sessions for Asthma, COPD, and Post-COVID recovery, featuring clinically-backed techniques like Diaphragmatic and Pursed-Lip Breathing.
* **Interactive Guidance:** The core breathing screen provides a **visual guide** with synchronized animations and timers for correct technique.
* **Gamified Adherence:** A unique rewards system where users earn **coins** for completing exercises, which can be used to redeem discounts on premium subscriptions.
* **Progress Tracking:** A personalized dashboard with interactive graphs and charts to help users monitor health trends and practice history.
* **User Accounts:** A simulated sign-in/sign-up flow to manage user data and progress.

## üß† The AI-Accelerated Development Process

This project demonstrates the power of **Prompt Engineering** and **Generative AI**. As a solo developer, I directed the AI to:

1.  **Code the Full Stack:** Used sophisticated prompts to generate the four-module application architecture.
2.  **Iterate on Feedback:** Refined and debugged the prototype through a continuous feedback loop (e.g., fixing the critical asynchronous bug in the breathing cycle logic).
3.  **Deliver a Stable MVP:** Proved that complex, high-quality, stable solutions can be delivered efficiently using AI-driven methods.
